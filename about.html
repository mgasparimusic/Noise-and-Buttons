          <h2>About Noise and Buttons:</h2>
          <p class="app-description-text"><b>Noise and Buttons</b> is a pioneering music education project that aims to make music education more accessible for neurodivergent students by integrating sensory-friendly hardware and software interfaces.  While the program is inclusive and open to all, its primary focus is on catering to the needs of the neurodivergent community.  At the heart of Noise and Buttons is a sandbox-styled application featuring a user-friendly music engine controlled by four buttons.  These buttons enable users to manipulate different musical elements, being tempo, rhythm, timbre, and harmony.  Each button is color coded with <span class="red-text">red</span>, <span class="yellow-text">yellow</span>, <span class="green-text">green</span> and <span class="blue-text">blue</span>; corresponding to <span class="red-text">tempo</span>, <span class="yellow-text">rhythm</span>, <span class="green-text">timbre</span>, and <span class="blue-text">harmony</span> respectively.  Through simple button presses, users can explore an extensive array of musical sounds, facilitating hours of exploration.  Complimenting the app is the Noise and Buttons Musical Learning Program, a comprehensive curriculum developed to guide students in learning the various aspects of music.  The program incorporates interactive exercises within the app and musical examples to reinforce concepts.  It comprises slideshows designed for classroom instruction and an eight-part video series, with two videos dedicated to each aspect of music.  Collectively, these components build one unifying goal: to make entry-level music education more accessible for everyone, eliminating the fear of where to start, and hopefully leading to students pursuing to continue studying the musical arts.</p>

          <p class="app-description-text">To play with the <b>Noise and Buttons</b> web app, click the "Play" button on the top menu bar, or click the link below:</p>
          <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <a class="play-button" href="play.html"><p class="play-button-text">Play</p></a>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p class="app-description-text">Depending on what controls you choose to use, the app will function differently.  Click on the name of your control device below to expand detailed instructions on how to control the app with that desired control scheme.</p>

            <h2>Buttons:</h2>
            <p class="app-description-text">Controlling the <b>Noise and Buttons</b> app with the button controller is easy.  There are four color-coded buttons that each control one of the four aspects of music.  What you will notice is that simple button clicks will result in random musical changes, while holding down the buttons will unlock more specific and controlled changes to the music.  Below are detailed descriptions on how to control the app with just these four buttons:</p>
            <div class="buttons-instruct-panel">
              <div style="padding: 5px;">
                <h2 style="color: lightsalmon">Red Button</h2>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightsalmon">The red button controls the speed of the music, which can be defined as <u>tempo</u>.</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightsalmon"><b>Quick Press</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightsalmon">A quick press will result in random tempo between 50-140bpm (beats-per-minute).</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightsalmon"><b>Press-and-Hold</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightsalmon">A press-and-hold will increase the tempo slowly until it reaches the max of 140bpm, where it will reverse and decrease until hitting the minimum of 50bpm, where it will increase again.  This will continue forever as long as the button is pressed down.  It will stop at the current tempo number once the button is released.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="padding: 5px;">
                <h2 style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">Yellow Button</h2>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">The yellow button controls how each beat is divided among the three voices of the app.  This can be defined as <u>rhythm</u>.</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow"><b>Quick Press</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">A quick press will result in random rhythmic divisions for each voice.  This can create some interesting rhythmic patterns</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow"><b>Press-and-Hold</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">A press-and-hold will affect the articulation of each note that is produced.  The attack and the decay of each note will increase and decrease, moving from a very pointed sound to a more smooth sound and vise-versa.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="padding: 5px;">
                <h2 style="color: lightgreen">Green Button</h2>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgreen">The green button controls the <u>timbre</u> of the entire sound.  Timbre is best defined as the character or quality of a musical sound.</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgreen"><b>Quick Press</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgreen">A quick press will result in random changes to some fun audio effects like echo and vibrato (which can make the sound feel silly and unstable)</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgreen"><b>Press-and-Hold</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightgreen">A press-and-hold will adjust the overall intensity of the sound by making it brighter and darker.  The movement of this change works similarly to the red button's tempo change</p>
              </div>
              <div style="padding: 5px;">
                <h2 style="color: lightblue">Blue Button</h2>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightblue">The blue button controls what notes out of specific scales of notes will randomly play when the app is on.  Harmony is all about combinations of similar notes played together to produce pleasing (or unpleasing) sounds</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightblue"><b>Quick Press</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightblue">A quick press will result in random scale to be selected from a specific category of scales which you can select with the drop-down list above the blue button interface.</p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightblue"><b>Press-and-Hold</b></p>
                <p class="app-description-text" style="color: lightblue">A press-and-hold will turn on and off voices.  There is a pattern that the app will follow when turning on and off voices.  It will cycle through different combinations of voices, until it ultimately reaches all three voices being on.</p>
